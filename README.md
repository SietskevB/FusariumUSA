# MANUSCRIPT TITLE

This repository contains code and files that support the analyses presented in MANUSCRIPT TITLE.
Raw sequencing data can be found LINK.

The ITS2 and 16S data was preprocessed separately. Therefore, in directory "Preprocessing", there is one directory for ITS2 and one for 16S preprocessing steps.
Directory "Figures and tables" contains code and files used for the figures and tables in the manuscript.

Unfortunately, some files were too large to include on GitHub. This includes several tables for the 16S preprocessing steps.
With the raw sequencing data however, it should be possible to follow our analyses using the code provided here.

## IMPORTANT
The field work originally included four fields. In the manuscript, data from three fields is shown.

One field was excluded due to low disease severity and uncertainty regarding the identity of the disease that was observed.
You can check the metadata for all fields, including the excluded field, in [USfields_samplingdata.xslx](USfields_samplingdata.xlsx).

In the files and code provided here, this excluded field was called "field 1".
Fields 1-3 in the manuscript correspond to fields 2-4 in the files and code.
